**Caption**: The image illustrates the concept of approximating the area under a curve defined by the function \( f(x) \). The shaded region, labeled \( A \), represents the area we aim to evaluate, bounded above by the curve \( f(x) \), below by the x-axis, and between the vertical lines \( x = a \) and \( x = b \). This geometric approach involves dividing the region into smaller shapes with known area formulas to sum their areas for an estimate of the total area under the curve. (1)

**Caption**: This image illustrates the left-endpoint approximation method for estimating the area under a curve. It features a graph with a continuous curve, where the area is approximated using rectangles. The heights of these rectangles are determined by evaluating the function at the left endpoints of each subinterval, represented by points along the x-axis. The text "Left endpoints" labels this method, highlighting that the rectangles are constructed based on function values at the left side of each subinterval. This visual aids in understanding how this method differs from the right-endpoint approximation described in the source document. (1)

**Caption**: The image depicts a right-endpoint approximation method for estimating the area under a curve. It illustrates the curve defined by the function \( f(x) \) along with six subintervals represented by vertical rectangles. The heights of these rectangles are determined by evaluating the function at the right endpoints of each subinterval. The graphic includes markers at the right endpoints labeled \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \), while also indicating the interval boundaries \( a \) and \( b \). This visual representation highlights how the area under the curve is approximated by summing the areas of the rectangles formed, distinct from a left-endpoint approximation where heights would be calculated at the left endpoints of each subinterval.

**Caption**: This image illustrates two methods for approximating the area under a curve represented by the function \( y = f(x) \). Panel (a) depicts the left-endpoint approximation where vertical lines are drawn at the left endpoints of each subinterval \( [x_i, x_{i+1}] \), resulting in rectangular areas that sum to estimate the area under the curve. Panel (b) shows the right-endpoint approximation, where vertical lines are drawn at the right endpoints of each subinterval, allowing for a different estimation of the area by calculating the areas of rectangles formed on the right side. Each rectangle's width is denoted by \( \Delta x \), highlighting the method of subdividing the interval to compute the area. (1)

**Caption**: The image depicts a graph illustrating the right-endpoint approximation of the area under the curve of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \). The shaded rectangles represent the right-endpoint method for estimating the area under the curve, with height determined by the function value at the right endpoint of each interval. The graph highlights the intervals of width \( \Delta x \) and indicates that the right-endpoint approximation yields a specific area value, distinct from the left-endpoint approximation discussed in the context.

**Caption**: This image illustrates the left-endpoint approximation (a) and right-endpoint approximation (b) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) over the interval from 1 to 2. In the left graph, rectangles are constructed using the left endpoints of subintervals to estimate the area under the curve, while in the right graph, rectangles are made using the right endpoints. The provided context explains that with a small number of intervals, both methods yield inaccurate estimates of the area under the curve. However, as the number of intervals increases, the approximations improve due to thinner rectangles that better conform to the curve.  (1)

**Caption**: This image illustrates a left-endpoint approximation for estimating the area under the curve \( y = f(x) \) over the interval from \( a = x_0 \) to \( b = x_4 \). The region is divided into four equal intervals, each represented by a rectangle whose height corresponds to the value of the function at the left endpoint (\( x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 \)). The rectangles approximate the area under the curve, although some area remains uncovered, depicted as white space under the curve. This technique is a foundational concept in integral calculus, emphasizing how increasing the number of intervals can reduce the white space and improve the approximation of the area under the curve.

**Caption**: This image illustrates a curve represented by the function \(y = f(x)\) along with eight rectangles inscribed under the curve. The rectangles are divided into equal widths along the interval from \(a = x_0\) to \(b = x_8\). This left-endpoint approximation technique aims to estimate the area under the curve.
