**Caption**: This image depicts an underwater scene filled with various fish swimming amongst coral and debris. Overlaid on the photo is a series of colored lines and dots, indicating tracking points that are commonly used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. The visual artifacts illustrate the challenges of maintaining accurate tracking in dynamic underwater environments, underscoring the difficulties faced in developing a robust SLAM system that can perform effectively despite these conditions.

**Caption**: The image displays two side-by-side views of an underwater scene, highlighting the effects of dynamic light on feature matching in visual processing. The vibrant purple points represent detected features within the area, illustrating how illumination changes can lead to inaccuracies in pose estimation and potential tracking failures in feature-based SLAM systems that utilize ORB features. This visual representation underlines the challenges posed by dynamic lighting in achieving reliable real-time performance in underwater settings. (1)
