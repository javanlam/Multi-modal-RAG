# Captioning Examples using CLIP and VLM

This directory contains results recorded from image captioning using a CLIP-based model and a VLM.

## Aim of this step

To perform embedding and indexing of images in documents along the text, it may be required to perform some preprocessing steps on the images for successfully embedding.
This trial approach attempts to caption the images, and embed the caption while tagging along the original image in indexing.
